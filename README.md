## Project Introduction
The problem that we are trying to solve is that we would like to create a place where users can easily share their notes in a neat and organized manner with other people who share an interest in their notes. A website like this could even be utilized like a blogging site where notes that are taken can be either for entertainment purposes or educational ones such as notes for classes.
Notey is a web application that allows users to add, delete or update their notes. 
In other words, Notey acts as a note management system. Several technologies were used.
Technologies used in this project are:
* React
* Docker
* Springboot
* H2
* Node
* Eclipse
